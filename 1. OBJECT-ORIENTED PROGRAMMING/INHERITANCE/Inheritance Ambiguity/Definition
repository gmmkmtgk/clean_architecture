In C++, inheritance ambiguity occurs when a class derives from multiple base classes, and these base classes have a member or function with the same name. This creates ambiguity for the derived class, as it doesn't know which base class member or function to use.

To resolve the ambiguity in inheritance, you can explicitly specify which base class's member or function you want to access using the scope resolution operator (::).
