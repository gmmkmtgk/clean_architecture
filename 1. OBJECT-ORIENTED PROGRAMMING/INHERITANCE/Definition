Modes of Inheritance 

1.Public mode: If we derive a subclass from a publicbase class. Then, the base classâ€™s public members will become public in the derived class, and protected class members will become protected in the derived class. 

2.Protected mode: If we derive a subclass from a Protectedbase class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class.

3.Private mode: If we derive a subclass from a Private base class. Then both public members and protected members of the base class will become Private in the derived class.

Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, which is necessary for hybrid inheritance.
